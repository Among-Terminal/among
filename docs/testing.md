# Verification aids

These controls are for automated application tests, not normal use.
Use an isolated test session: input automation must never target personal terminals.

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `AMONG_SELFCHECK` | Reports live widget, plugin and slot state to stderr. |
| `AMONG_SELFCHECK_TICKS` | Limits reports; default `120`. |
| `AMONG_SCRIPT` | Reads startup actions from a file. |
| `AMONG_ACTION` | Runs one startup action. |
| `AMONG_REBIND` | Overrides bindings for this launch. |
| `AMONG_ENABLE` / `AMONG_DISABLE` | Overrides selected plugin switches for this launch. |
| `AMONG_COLOR_SCHEME` | Selects `light` or `dark`. |
| `AMONG_LIST_BINDINGS` | Prints bindings and exits without opening a window. |

Script actions include `split_pane`, `close_pane`, `new_workspace`, `focus_left`,
`resize_right` (also `resize_left`, `resize_up`, `resize_down`), `zoom`, `fullscreen`,
`preferences` and `next_workspace`.
`workspace_N` activates workspace N, counting from 1. `type:<command>` sends text
to the focused terminal; `feed:<pane>:<command>` targets a numbered pane.
In these commands, `~` represents a space.
`collapse-sidebar`, `expand-sidebar` and `request-close` exercise window controls.

`scroll:<pane>:<delta>` hands one touch surface delta to the same handler a real
gesture reaches, so a check can exercise touchpad scrolling on hardware that
cannot produce one: XTEST sends wheel clicks and nothing else. The delta is in
surface pixels and negative scrolls towards older output. The step reports
`pane`, `delta`, the row height, whether it moved the history, and the value and
limits of the terminal's scroll adjustment, so a failing scroll check can be
read from the log. There is deliberately no wheel form: wheel clicks are the
terminal library's own, a harness can send a real one, and the library offers no
way to ask for one programmatically.

The self-check line carries `pane_scroll=["<pane>:<lines back>@<row height>", ...]`,
which is zero while a terminal shows its newest output and grows while it shows
older output.

See [contributor checks](../CONTRIBUTING.md#checking-changes) for isolated X11 tests.

## Where checks keep their evidence

`among-tools` checks create private work directories (application home,
configuration, logs, screenshots) below one check root and leave them there
as evidence:

1. `AMONG_CHECK_ROOT`, if set; it must be an absolute path.
2. Otherwise `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/among/checks`.
3. Otherwise `$HOME/.cache/among/checks`.

A missing root is created with mode `0700`. The location is on disk on
purpose: evidence must survive a reboot, so do not point it at a `tmpfs`
such as `/tmp`. Old evidence is not removed automatically; delete runs you no
longer need.

The display harness passes `AMONG_CHECK_ROOT` to every command it runs. The
application's ignored graphical tests refuse to start unless their
configuration directory lies below that root, so they never touch personal
configuration. CI workflows set the root explicitly.
